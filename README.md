## Project description
It's a complete product development, of a cost effective radio transmitter and receiver utilizing Arduino and NRF24 tranceiver module. I started with drawing the schematic, then I did component selection, and after that PCB designing and testing. When the PCB stood out in the process of testing, component assembly, and soldering were done. The enclosure is made up of PVC sheet. The finished product comes out good, also the guaranteed connection range between two module is 600 metres(measured).

## PCB Routing 
I faced design challanges when routing, component placement & positioning, But overall product development project experiance was awesome.
